## Prodev Hackathon

### Problem Definition

We decided to focus of efficient dividends distribution for security tokens, and accompanying solutions to the related security tokens activities.

## Solution

### Overview

We are developed a reliable automation that performs the dividends distribution process. Our solutions powered by the Ensemble platform. Ensemble is a platform that makes it easy to create and securely execute automated workflows that operate over multiple smart contracts and networks.

## How to run

In case you want to run the solution locally, here's the guide:
- Read the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/ensemble-codes/ensemble-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to setup the environment.
- Use [dividends manual](https://github.com/ensemble-codes/ensemble-cli/blob/main/manuals/dividents.md) to get the guideline how to run the dedicated workflow.
- https://docs.ensemble.codes/

## Important notes

While Ensemble inteface is on the roadmap, we suggest to use the [Ensemble CLI](https://github.com/ensemble-codes/ensemble-cli) to interact with the platform. Using the CLI, you can create, read, update and delete your workflows.
